            <p>For giveaways or raffles conducted with our tools, we will only store the following information if the user running the raffle decides to store the result by utilizing the share buttons or copy link button. The specific details we might store (depending on the tool used) include:
                <br /><br />
                Information about the winner (name, profile link, and picture).<br />

If you choose not to store the result of your giveaway and close your browser, the data will be permanently deleted. Retrieving this data will not be possible, so it's important to store the result if desired.
                <br /><br />
                When you log in to our tool using your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), certain information will be stored in your browser. This enables automatic login on subsequent tool access, eliminating the need for additional authentication. You can remove this stored information by clearing your browser data, cookies, and removing our app from Facebook.
                <br /><br />
                We may also store non-personal data in your browser via cookies, session data, or local storage to enhance the user experience or manage specific limits and features of our tools. This can be deleted by clearing your browser data.

            <h4>TERMS OF SERVICE</h4>
            <p>Please find detailed information about our terms of service below. It is essential to read and understand them before utilizing our tools.
            </p>
            <h4>FACEBOOK & INSTAGRAM TOOLS</h4>
            <p>Our Facebook Tools and Instagram Tools utilize the Facebook Graph API from Meta to access data.
                <br /><br />
                The RandomeR app has undergone a review and approval process by Facebook, enabling it to use specific permissions for retrieving data. It's important to note that we only have read permissions, meaning we cannot post anything on your account. However, in order to obtain the accurate data, you must grant RandomeR the necessary read permissions on your behalf.
                <br /><br />
                During the Facebook login process, you will be prompted to allow access to these permissions. You have the ability to select which accounts or pages we can access. Rest assured that we only request the permissions required for our tool to function properly.
                <br /><br />
                Please be aware that we do not store or sell any of your Facebook and Instagram data.
                <br /><br />
                It is important to note that the results of our tools cannot be manipulated. We employ the following method for randomness:
                <br /><br />
                Math.random(): This client-side method utilizes JavaScript and operates directly within your browser. Our server does not process this randomness, ensuring that we have no influence over the raffle outcomes.<br />
                For most tools, randomness is implemented on the client side, meaning it is executed within your browser without our server's involvement. Rest assured that we strive to maintain transparency and fairness throughout all our tools.
                <br /><br />
